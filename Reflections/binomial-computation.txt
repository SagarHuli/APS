   A.For computing the combination of a large number say C(n,k) in this case :
      1. Recursive program uses pow(2,n)*k*sizeof(data type) memory.
      2. 2D array uses n*k*sizeof(data type) memory. 
      3. 1D array uses k*sizeof(data type) memory.
      
   B. If the space complexity is not an issue:
      1. Recursive program has to refer to stack memory in every iteration(Computational time is high).
      2. Dynamic program maintains a 2D array which refers to the stored results in the previous iteration(Computational time is low).
      3. If the function does not demand all the co-efficients to return, 1D array is preferred(Computational time is comparitively                lesser).
